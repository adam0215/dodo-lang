Dodo Lang is an extended/modified version of the Monkey Programming Language and its interpreter implemented throughout the book [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball. Highly recommend it.

Following are the additional features I've added or things I've changed in the language.

1. Ability to pick a character in a string by index.
1. Ability to quickly get the last element of an array or string by using index -1.
1. Ability to run .dodo files using the -f <filename> flag.
1. Ability to call built in functions on objects using dot syntax.
1. A typeof() function.
1. A preliminary debug() print function.
